                        <p>Each International Federation establishes its own sport's rules for participation at the Olympic Games, including qualification criteria in accordance with the Olympic Charter. Some are based on ranking, some have specific Olympic Qualifying Tournaments while some use existing competitions to define the qualified teams or athletes. Others require athletes to reach a minimal time or distance in their discipline. There are as many ways to qualify for the Olympic Games as there are disciplines.</p>

                        <p>There are different rules for each discipline of sport climbing:
                            <br><br>
                            In bouldering, athletes climb 4.5 m high walls without ropes, in a limited period of time and in the fewest attempts possible. The ranking is decided by the number of problems overcome.
                            <br><br>
                            In the lead event, athletes climb with a rope as high as they can on a wall over 15m high in six minutes without having seen the route ahead of time. It requires all of the athletes’ physical and mental abilities.
                            <br><br>
                            Speed is a spectacular race against the clock in one-on-one elimination rounds that combine precision and explosivity. The wall is 15m high and with an inclination of five degrees. The World Record for men is 5.00 seconds for men (Kiromal Katibin, Indonesia) and 6.53 for women (Aleksandra Miroslaw, Poland).</p>
